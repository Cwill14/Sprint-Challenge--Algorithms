#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
    O(n), because we are in a loop that will run a variable amount of times

b)
    <!-- O(n^2) because we have a loop inside of a loop -->
    O(n), because the n is the dominant part ?

c)
    <!-- O(n) I think, because everything inside the recursion is an O(1)? -->
    O(n^2) because there is recursion?

## Exercise II

<!-- we will have to take in two variables, (n, f)
if n < f, then that building basically is impossible to exist.
otherwise -->
<!-- 
if egg is thrown of floor f:
    egg broken
else:
    not broken -->

how are ever supposed to figure out f without more information given than just the height of building??? does f change with every building?? if this was realistic, wouldn't f be the same no matter the building height?
